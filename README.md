# Stress Detection 

## Overview

This Python script showcases stress detection using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including the creation of a word cloud. The script uses the `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `wordcloud`, and `matplotlib` libraries. Users can input text data, and the script visualizes stress-related words and predicts stress levels. Explore this script to understand the basics of stress detection and visualization in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, and others if required).
- **User Input:** Code for user input to provide text data for stress detection.
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for stress detection.
- **Word Cloud Generation:** Creating a word cloud to visualize stress-related words.
- **NLP Model Training:** Utilizing `scikit-learn` for text classification and stress level prediction.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the word cloud and stress level prediction.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install nltk scikit-learn wordcloud matplotlib` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`stress_detection.py`) in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input text data for stress detection.
4. The script will visualize a word cloud and predict stress levels based on the provided text.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset or text input with your own stress-related data.
- Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques or machine learning models for stress detection.
- Modify the script to include additional features or visualizations.
